        <name>Squats</name>
        <color>Yellow</color>
        <description>The squat is the king of lower body exercises.
          A properly executed squat is not only safe (opposed to what some people claim)
          but also involves all lower body muscles in addition to upper body ones as well.
          In order to have well developed legs, the Squat is a must!
